# 🕸️ **Harmonic Oscillator Network Embedding (HONE)** Framework 🕸️

This framework treats networks like a system of connected oscillators:
- **Nodes** are represented as round objects (particles).
- **Edges** are modeled as springs connecting the nodes.

Using classical mechanics principles, the **HONE framework** computes equilibrium configurations to map network topology while quantifying its complexity through the **Harmonic Network Inconsistency (HNI)** metric. 📈

⚙️ Advanced Usage:

HONE provides a flexible interface for customization:

- **`iterations`**: Set the number of iterations for the numerical solver.
- **`dim`**: Define the dimensionality of the embedding space.
- **`seed_ensemble`**: Control the number of ensemble runs to compute HNI.
- **`dt`**: Adjust the time step for the dynamics.
- **`gamma`**: Modify the damping coefficient for harmonic oscillations.

> **⚠️ Note**: Avoid setting `gamma` to `0` or very low values to prevent numerical instability caused by floating-point errors. Choose small but non-zero values when a low damping effect is desired.

## 🌟 **Key Highlights**
1. **Dual Implementation**:
   - **`GPU_HONE.py`**: Optimized for CUDA-enabled GPUs to accelerate computations.
   - **`CPU_HONE.py`**: CPU-based version for systems without GPU support.
2. **Node Dynamics**: Understand how individual nodes (particles) interact in a network.
3. **Spring-like Edges**: Capture structural dependencies via harmonic couplings.
4. **Global Perspective**: Analyze energy landscapes for insights into configurational variability.
5. **Harmonic Network Inconsistency (HNI)**: Quantifies network complexity and variability.
